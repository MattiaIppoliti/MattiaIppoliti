# Ciao! ðŸ‘‹, I'm Mattia Ippoliti

I'm a Software Engineer living in Turin. I've been a **Python Programmer**, since **October 2016**.

Currently working as **Solutions Architect** @ **Intesa SanPaolo**, I hold a II Level Master in Quantum Computing and a Master Degree in Computer Science. Iâ€™m curious about how we can support better interactions with computers and data, and be more responsible stewards of technology. In this era of my life, Iâ€™m working towards being someone who is unabashedly excited and curious about the world.

Btw, if you're a developer or a team trying to showcase your projects to a bigger audience, try to take a looker at [Ciao!](https://ciaobang.com).

I'm, a Software developer living in Turin, specialized in **Python**. I've been a **Python Programmer**, since **October 2016**. 

Iâ€™m currently working as **Data Engineer** @ **Intesa San Paolo**. Apart from my full time work I'm a graduated student with a Master Degree in Computer Science and Automation Engineering. I consider myself a very resolute person with a strong sense of responsibility, striving for perfection and ready to give my best in every circumstance by combining skills, knowledge and passion. Moreover my studies allowed myself to acquire a form of thought based on the continuous search for improvement both in work and in myself. I feel a strong attraction towards those challenges that require solid intellectual or designing skills and a strong practical sense.

Skills:
- Python, C, Java
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript & Bootstrap
- SQL
- Public Speaking

I like to:
- develop the software that would solve the real problems and makes the world a better place.
- flexibility and trust: I work for people that care about outcomes
- push my limits in competitive programming
- help the community around me by sharing my knowledge

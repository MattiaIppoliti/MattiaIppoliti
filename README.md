# Hola! ðŸ‘‹, I'm Mattia Ippoliti

I'm a Software developer living in Turin, specialized in **Python**. I've been a **Python Programmer**, since **October 2016**. 

Iâ€™m currently working as **Software Engineer** @ **Intesa SanPaolo** Apart from my full time work I hold a II Level Master in Quantum Computing and a Master Degree in Computer Science and Automation Engineering.

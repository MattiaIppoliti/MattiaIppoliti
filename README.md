# Hola! ðŸ‘‹, I'm Mattia Ippoliti

I'm a Software developer living in Turin, specialized in **Python**. I've been a **Python Programmer**, since **October 2016**. 

Currently working as **Software Engineer** @ **Intesa SanPaolo**, I hold a II Level Master in Quantum Computing and a Master Degree in Computer Science and Automation Engineering. I feel a strong attraction towards those challenges that require solid intellectual or designing skills and a strong practical sense.

Iâ€™m curious about how we can better incentivize public goods funding, support better interactions with computers and data, and be more responsible stewards of technology. In this era of my life, Iâ€™m working towards being someone who is unabashedly excited and curious about the world.
